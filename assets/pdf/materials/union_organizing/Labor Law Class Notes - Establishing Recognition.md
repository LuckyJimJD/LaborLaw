2. Appropriate Bargaining Unit
2.1. Types of Unit
- § 9(b): Appropriate units
  - Employer unit
  - Craft unit
  - Plant unit
  - Sub-plant unit

- § 9(b)(1): Professional employees
  - May be included in unit with non-professionals only if majority of professionals vote in favor
- § 9(b)(2): Craft units
- § 9(b)(3): Guards

2.2. Community of Interest
*Friendly Ice Cream Corp.*
- Facts & Procedural History
  - Union petitioned for single-store unit
  - Employer argued for broader unit:
    - All stores nationwide, or
    - All stores within geographic region
  - Board found single-store unit appropriate
- Holding & Analysis
  - Statute gives Board authority to determine appropriate unit
  - Statute only requires “an appropriate unit”, not the “most appropriate”
  - Board may give priority to employees’ interest, while taking into account employer’s interests
  - Community of Interest factors
    - Geographic proximity of stores
    - Level of employee interchange among stores
    - Degree of autonomy exercised by local store manager, esp. regarding labor relations
    - Extent of union organization
    - History of collective bargaining
    - Desires of employees
    - Employer’s organizational framework
    - Similarity in skills, benefits, wages, & hours
  - Board applies rebuttable presumption that single-store unit is appropriate
    - Where local store management has autonomy over day-to-day supervision, single-store unit will be appropriate even though there is some central management control over employment policies

*Virginia Mfg. Co. (VAMCO)*
- Unit of production & maintenance employees
  - Excluding office clerical employees
- Differences in job function justifies exclusion of office clerical workers from unit
  - But employee with similar, or inter-related, job functions, shares a community of interest, despite greater technical skill and higher pay
