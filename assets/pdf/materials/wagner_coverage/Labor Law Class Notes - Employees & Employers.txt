### 1. Coverage of the Act: Employees & Employers

#### 1.1. Significance of “Employee” and “Employer” Categories 

##### 1.1.1. Employee-Employer Relation as Central Organizing Principle
- Despite its radical incursion on “traditional managerial prerogatives”, the Act preserves the fundamental distinction between “employee” and “employer”

##### 1.1.2. The Capitalist Labor Process
- Structural features of modern capitalism:
- Separation of Ownership & Control in the corporate form
- Separation of Conception/Direction & Execution on the shop floor
- Under system of formally free labor, employee works in exchange for wage
- Marx: Distinction between “labor power” and “labor”
- Capitalist labor relations are inherently conflictual, because of the structural relationship between employee & employer
- The Act takes the conflictual nature of labor relations as a premise, and seeks to regulate/channel that conflict
- Does so by limiting management’s absolute control over terms & conditions, and imposing a contractual regime 
- Problem for management is to make sure they get what they pay for
- Various solutions:
- piecework
- technical control over work process & deskilling (“Scientific Management”)
- surveillance 
- inculcation of self-discipline 

### 2. “Employers” Under the Act
#### 2.1 Categorical Exclusions
- Government employers
- Agricultural employers

#### 2.2 Commerce Requirement
- Gross annual sales

#### 2.3 Joint Employers
- Control 

### 3. “Employees” Under the Act

#### 3.1. Statutory definition of “employee”
- Section 2(3): “The term ‘employee’ shall include any employee, and shall not be limited to the employees of a particular employer ...”
- Express exclusions:
- agricultural laborer
- domestic service
- employed by parent or spouse
- independent contractor
- supervisor
- defined in Section 2(11)
- Railway Labor Act employees
- Why exclude “supervisors”?
- “Supervisor” is agent of the employer
- Allowing supervisors to bargain as employees would be conflict of interest
- This presumes conflict between management & labor
- Note that, under some public employee labor laws, first-line supervisors are covered
- e.g. PA-PERA: put in separate units and given more limited rights

#### 3.2. “Contingent Workers”
- Segmented labor markets

#### 3.3. Independent Contractors
- Test: “Right of Control”
- Roadway Package System (NLRB 1998)
- How significant is the drivers’ supposed “proprietary interest” in their routes?
- How significant is it that the drivers perform “an essential part of the company’s normal operations”?
- Should this be a determinative factor?
- Should companies be able to “contract out” their core operational functions as a means of avoiding liability as employers? 
- What other considerations, apart from labor/employment law, might prompt companies to classify these workers as independent contractors? 
- FedEx Ground cases
- Wilmington, Mass. terminal: R-Petition by Teamsters
- DC Circuit overruled Board’s decision
- Court focused on “significant opportunity for entrepreneurial gain or loss” 
- Do FedEx drivers really have such opportunity, independent of the company itself?
- Should this be a factor in any event, where the worker performs the core function of the company, and is dependent on the company for work? 
- Should the test focus on bargaining power, which is at the core of the Act’s policy? 
- California class action (Estrada)
- National class action
- Cross-motions for summary judgment
- In majority of cases, district court decided in favor of company
- Cases on appeal
- See Craig v. FedEx Ground, 686 F.3d 423 (7th Cir. 2012) (certifying question to Kansas state supreme court as to meaning of “employee” under state wage payment act)

#### 3.4. Leased Employees
- Oakwood Care Center (NLRB 2004)
- Issue: Whether bargaining unit may include both core and “leased” employees working at same job
- Holding: Such a unit is a “multiemployer” unit, requiring consent of both employers
- Section 9(b): appropriate unit
- Majority says text (“employer unit”) does not authorize multi-employer units
- Is that a fair reading of the text?
- Is a contrary reading also defensible? 
- Majority recognizes Board practice of recognizing multi-employer units where all parties agree
- But if text of statute doesn’t authorize such units, does the Board have authority to recognize them even with the parties’ consent?
